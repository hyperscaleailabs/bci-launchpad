    # 05 · Dagster for scientific workflows

    **Goal.** Understand what a workflow orchestrator is *for* in a research platform, using
    Dagster's vocabulary — assets, ops, jobs, resources, partitions, sensors, schedules,
    materializations, lineage, retries — and see exactly how the repository's closed loop
    uses each one. We first build a toy pipeline small enough to read in one screen, then run
    the platform's real asset graph for two experimental rounds (Ray Train DDP, MLflow,
    gated registry, Ray actors) and interrogate the Dagster instance for lineage.

    ## 1. Conceptual model

    **Ops and jobs** describe *computations*: a job is a DAG of ops, and running it is a
    *run*. That is the model of Airflow-style task schedulers: "execute step B after step A".

    **Software-defined assets** describe *things that should exist*: a dataset, a model, a
    report. An asset declares its upstream assets and a function that (re)computes it.
    Executing the function is a **materialization**, recorded with metadata in the instance's
    event log. Jobs still exist — `define_asset_job` selects a subset of assets — but the
    durable object is the asset and its history, not the run.

    ```text
    ops/jobs  (verbs):  run#41: load → clean → train → eval        "did the job succeed?"
    assets    (nouns):  training_dataset[round_002] ──► trained_model[round_002]
                           materialized by run#41, dataset_hash=9c1f…, 820 rows
                                                       "which model came from which data?"
    ```

    | Concept | In this repo |
    |---|---|
    | asset | 9 assets, `candidate_pool → … → new_experimental_results` (`orchestration/assets.py`) |
    | partition | dynamic partition set `rounds` = `round_000, round_001, …` (`partitions.py`) |
    | resource | `PlatformConfigResource`, `RoundStoreResource`, `TrackingResource`, `RayComputeResource` (`resources.py`) |
    | job | `bootstrap_job`, `closed_loop_round_job`, `retrain_job` (`jobs.py`) |
    | sensor | `new_round_sensor`: a new round appears in the RoundStore → run the loop for it |
    | schedule | `nightly_retrain_schedule`: `0 2 * * *` retrain/re-evaluate the latest round |
    | materialization metadata | dataset/manifest hashes, MLflow run id + URL, model version, gate decision, selection hash |
    | retry policy | exponential backoff on compute assets; **none** on `new_experimental_results` |

    ### Dagster scheduling vs Ray scheduling

    Both are "schedulers", at different altitudes:

    | | Dagster | Ray |
    |---|---|---|
    | decides | **what** to (re)compute and **when**; in which order; for which round | **where** each piece runs and on **how many** workers/CPUs/GPUs |
    | unit | asset materialization / step (minutes–hours) | task / actor method call (ms–minutes) |
    | state | durable: runs, events, lineage, partitions in `$DAGSTER_HOME` | ephemeral: object store, actor state; gone after `ray.shutdown()` |
    | failure handling | re-run a whole *step* (RetryPolicy), or a human re-materializes | restart a task/actor/worker group; Ray Train restores from the last checkpoint |
    | in this repo | `trained_model` says "train on `training_dataset[round_r]` with 2 workers" | `TorchTrainer` places 2 DDP workers, sets rank/world size, restarts on worker loss |

    Dagster calls Ray *through a resource* (`RayComputeResource.client()` → `RayCompute`), so
    no asset knows whether Ray is local, a Docker Compose head node or a KubeRay cluster.
    """),
    md(r"""
    ## 2. Why an experimental dataset is an asset, not a job step

    In a job-step design, "run experiments" is a function call inside run #41 and its output
    is an intermediate value. In the asset design, `round_003` is a named, partitioned,
    versioned object:

    * **Identity & lineage.** Every model, report and selection can point at
      `observed_experiments[round_003]` and its `manifest_hash`; the UI can answer "which
      models were trained on data that includes round 3?".
    * **Different lifecycles.** A round is produced once (expensive, irreproducible noise) but
      *consumed* many times — by every later training run, the nightly retrain, ad-hoc
      re-evaluation. Steps are ephemeral; datasets outlive the runs that made them.
    * **Arrival is external.** In a real lab, round 3 arrives when the plate reader finishes,
      possibly days later and from outside the platform. An asset can be materialized by
      whoever produces it; a sensor reacts to it appearing. A job step cannot "arrive".
    * **Staleness.** When code or config changes, Dagster can tell that `trained_model` is
      stale relative to its upstream — but it must *never* recompute `round_003` by re-running
      the experiment. Modelling the round as an asset with **no retry** and a write-once store
      makes that explicit.
    * **Partitions = rounds.** Dynamic partitions give "one materialization per round" for
      free: backfills, per-round status, and a natural key shared with `data/rounds/round_XXX`.

    The loop closes *across* partitions: `new_experimental_results[round_r]` writes
    `round_{r+1}` into the RoundStore and registers the new partition key. A static asset edge
    back to `observed_experiments` would be a cycle; the RoundStore is the hand-off point.
    """),
    md(r"""
    ## 3. Retry semantics — a small derivation

    Suppose a step fails transiently with probability $p$ per attempt, independently, and has a
    retry policy with $k$ retries. Then

    $$
    P(\text{success}) = 1 - p^{\,k+1}, \qquad
    \mathbb E[\text{attempts}] = \sum_{i=0}^{k} p^{i} = \frac{1 - p^{k+1}}{1 - p}.
    $$

    With $p = 0.1$ and $k = 2$ (the repo's `COMPUTE_RETRY`), success rises from 90 % to 99.9 %
    at an expected cost of 1.11 attempts. For a **pure, deterministic** computation (training
    on a fixed dataset with fixed seeds, scoring a pool) a retry is harmless: every attempt
    produces the same thing, so *at-least-once* execution is fine.

    A physical experiment is different. If a failure happens *after* the samples are consumed
    but *before* the results are persisted (probability $q$ per attempt), a blind retry
    policy runs the experiment again. The expected number of physical executions becomes
    $\sum_{i=0}^{k} q^{i}$, and each costs money, time and — worse — produces a *different*
    noisy measurement, so the recorded result depends on how many times it failed. The
    platform therefore wants **at-most-once** physical execution + **idempotent** persistence:

    * `new_experimental_results` has **no** `RetryPolicy` → a failure goes to a human;
    * measurements are journaled by the `ExperimentSimulator` actor, so a re-run replays the
      recorded values instead of re-measuring;
    * the RoundStore is write-once: same content → no-op, different content → refused.

    ## 4. Toy pipeline: a resource, dynamic partitions, `materialize`, metadata

    A self-contained miniature of the platform: a `Lab` **resource** (the only thing that knows

    | Concept | Where |
    |---|---|
    | asset graph, metadata, retry policies (`COMPUTE_RETRY`, `LIGHT_RETRY`, none on the lab) | `src/merge_platform/orchestration/assets.py` |
    | step functions the assets wrap (no Dagster import) | `orchestration/pipeline.py` → `observe_round`, `build_training_dataset`, `train_model`, `evaluate_model`, `register_model`, `score_candidates`, `select_experiments`, `run_experiments` |
    | dynamic round partitions | `orchestration/partitions.py` → `rounds_partitions`, `ensure_round_partition` |
    | resources (Dagster → Ray/MLflow/RoundStore) | `orchestration/resources.py` → `RayComputeResource`, `TrackingResource`, `RoundStoreResource`, `PlatformConfigResource` |
    | jobs + programmatic runs | `orchestration/jobs.py` → `bootstrap_job`, `closed_loop_round_job`, `retrain_job`, `run_bootstrap`, `run_round` |
    | sensor / schedule | `orchestration/sensors.py` → `new_round_sensor`, `nightly_retrain_schedule` |
    | code location | `orchestration/definitions.py` → `build_definitions`, `defs`; `make dagster`, `make validate` |
    | driving the loop | `scripts/run_closed_loop.py` (`make closed-loop`) |

    ## 12. Failure modes

    * **Science in assets.** An asset body with the acquisition function inline is untestable
      without Dagster and couples scientific changes to orchestration deploys. Keep assets as
      glue (resolve resources → call one step function → return metadata).
    * **Retrying a physical experiment.** A `RetryPolicy` on the lab step turns a crash
      after measurement into a duplicate (and different) measurement. Use no retry + journal
      + write-once store (§3, §9).
    * **Passing data through the IO manager.** Pickling a 100 000-row pool per asset per
      partition into `$DAGSTER_HOME` duplicates data with no content identity. Pass paths and
      hashes; store data in a real store.
    * **Dagster as a GPU scheduler.** Using Dagster's multiprocess executor or op
      concurrency to place training workers duplicates Ray's job badly (no gang scheduling,
      no placement groups, no DDP restart). Dagster says "train with N workers"; Ray places them.
    * **Static partitions for rounds.** A fixed list of rounds forces a guess about the
      campaign length and breaks when a lab adds an unplanned round. Rounds are dynamic.
    * **Cycles in the graph.** "Results feed the next round" drawn as an asset edge creates a
      cycle. Close the loop across partitions through a durable store + sensor.
    * **Non-deterministic compute behind a retry.** Retries are only safe if the step is
      deterministic or idempotent; otherwise the metadata of attempt 3 does not describe
      attempts 1–2's side effects (e.g. MLflow runs left `RUNNING`).
    * **Sensor without a cursor / run key.** Every tick re-requests the same round. The repo
      uses a cursor *and* `run_key = round + manifest hash`.

    ## 13. Exercise

    1. In §5, change `toy_fit` to fail on attempts 0–3 with `max_retries=3`. What does the run
       report, and what is materialized? Now add `Backoff.EXPONENTIAL` with `delay=1` and
       predict the total wall time before running it.
    2. Using §8, add a column "production version at scoring time" from
       `registered_model.production_version` and explain why round 1 might score candidates with
       a model *older* than the one trained in round 1.
    3. Run `run_round(defs, instance, 2)` (≈15 s). Re-run the §8 checks for three rounds.
       Then evaluate `new_round_sensor` with `cursor="2"` again: what changed, and why?
    4. Write a sensor that triggers `retrain_job` when the config file changes (hint: put
       `hash_file(cfg_path)` in the cursor). Why is that a `retrain_job` and not a
       `closed_loop_round_job`?
