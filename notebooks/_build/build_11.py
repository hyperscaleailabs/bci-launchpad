        # 11 · Fault tolerance and distributed-systems semantics

        Every component of the platform will eventually fail mid-operation: a Ray worker is OOM-killed,
        a spot node disappears during epoch 7, the Dagster run is retried after a network blip, a lab
        instrument times out after half a plate. The question is never *whether* work is repeated,
        but **what happens when it is**.

        The central distinction of this notebook:

        > **Retrying a computation is cheap and safe if it is deterministic and side-effect free.
        > Retrying a physical experiment is neither** — it costs money and time, consumes material,
        > and returns a *different* noisy answer. The system must record each measurement exactly once
        > and re-use the record on every retry.

        ## Conceptual model

        **Delivery / execution semantics** for an operation that may be retried after a failure:

        | Semantics | How | Risk | Where it is acceptable |
        |---|---|---|---|
        | at-most-once | never retry | lost work | expensive, non-repeatable actions without dedup (a *physical* measurement request) |
        | at-least-once | retry until acknowledged | **duplicates** | pure, deterministic computation (scoring a shard, a bootstrap chunk) |
        | exactly-once (*effect*) | at-least-once **+ idempotent / deduplicated effect** | needs a stable key and durable record | writing an experimental round, recording a measurement |

        "Exactly-once" is not a network guarantee — no protocol can deliver it over an unreliable
        channel (the two-generals problem). It is a **system property** built from retries plus an
        idempotent sink:

        $$\text{apply}(k, v)\;\text{twice} \equiv \text{apply}(k, v)\;\text{once} \quad\text{for a stable key }k.$$

        If each attempt fails independently with probability $p$ and we retry up to $R$ times, the
        operation still fails with probability $p^{R+1}$ and the expected number of executions is
        $\sum_{i=0}^{R} p^i = \frac{1-p^{R+1}}{1-p}$ — i.e. *every* retry policy with $R\ge1$ executes some
        operations more than once. Duplicates are the normal case, not an edge case.

        **Durable vs ephemeral state** in this platform:

        ```text
        ephemeral (lost on crash)                    durable (survives, versioned)
        ───────────────────────────                  ──────────────────────────────────────────
        Ray worker memory, actor fields      ──►     RoundStore rounds (write-once parquet + manifest)
        object store (ObjectRefs)                    checkpoints: epoch_XXXX/ + `latest` (atomic)
        in-flight Serve requests                     ExperimentSimulator journal (JSONL)
        Trainer optimizer state (in RAM)             MLflow runs / registry, evaluation artifacts
        ```

        A crash may lose anything on the left; recovery = rebuild it from the right.

        The fix is not "fewer retries"; it is making the side effect **idempotent**: key it by a stable

        ## 3 · The `ExperimentSimulator` actor: never measure twice

        The oracle stands in for the lab. `ray_runtime.tasks.ExperimentSimulator` is a Ray **actor**

        * `measure(round_id, ids)` performs *new* measurements only for keys not in the log; repeats
          are cache hits (`n_physical_measurements` does not grow) → **idempotent**;

          dedup survives an actor restart (**durable**);
        * the actor is declared `max_restarts=1, max_task_retries=0`: Ray restarts a crashed actor, but
          does **not** automatically re-send an in-flight `measure` call — whether to re-request is a
          decision for the caller, who can do so safely because the call is idempotent.

        `Trainer.train(..., resume_from=dir)` restores model, optimizer, epoch counter, history,
        normaliser **and all RNG states**, so the resumed run is bit-identical to an uninterrupted one.
        Ray Train does the same across processes (`training/distributed.py` →
        `train_distributed(fail_at_epoch=..., max_failures=1)`).

        The cost of a failure is bounded by the checkpoint interval: with interval $c$ epochs, epoch time
        $t$ and checkpoint cost $w$, the expected loss per failure is about $c\,t/2$ of recomputation,
        while checkpointing costs $w/c$ per epoch — the classic Young/Daly trade-off

        ## Connection to this repository

        | Mechanism | Where | Semantics |
        |---|---|---|
        | write-once rounds, content hash, atomic rename, read-only files | `src/bci_platform/data/datasets.py` → `RoundStore.write_round`, `ImmutableRoundError`, `RoundSequenceError`, `verify_chain` | exactly-once *effect* |
        | reproducible measurement noise per `(oracle seed, round, seed)` | `src/bci_platform/data/generation.py` → `measure_candidates` | makes a retried materialisation identical |
        | measurement log + journal, `max_task_retries=0` | `src/bci_platform/ray_runtime/tasks.py` → `ExperimentSimulator`, `start_experiment_simulator` | at-most-once physical execution, idempotent requests |
        | transient-error retries | `ray_runtime/tasks.py` → `_bootstrap_chunk` (`retry_exceptions=[TransientTaskError]`), `parallel_bootstrap_ci` | at-least-once, deterministic |
        | model-cache actors with restarts | `src/bci_platform/inference/batch.py` → `PredictorActor` (`max_restarts=1, max_task_retries=1`) | at-least-once scoring (pure) |
        | atomic checkpoints, `latest` pointer, RNG state | `src/bci_platform/training/checkpointing.py` → `save_checkpoint`, `resolve_checkpoint`; `trainer.py` → `Trainer.train(fail_at_epoch, resume_from)`, `SimulatedWorkerFailure` | resume = replay from durable state |
        | Ray Train restarts from the last reported checkpoint | `src/bci_platform/training/distributed.py` → `train_distributed(max_failures=...)` | |
        | versioned selections | `src/bci_platform/active_learning/loop.py` → `select_batch` (`selection_hash`), `write_selection` | idempotent rewrite |
        | orchestration retries | Dagster retry policies on assets in `src/bci_platform/orchestration/` — safe *because* the sinks above are idempotent | |

        ## Failure modes

        * **Retrying a side effect** — at-least-once execution duplicates appends, emails, instrument
          runs (§1). Key every side effect and make it idempotent.
        * **Overwriting history** — "just re-run round 3" silently replaces the data a registered model
          was trained on; lineage breaks. `ImmutableRoundError` makes this impossible.
        * **Non-atomic writes** — a crash mid-write leaves a half-file that a later reader trusts.
          Write to temp + rename; publish a pointer (`latest`, manifest) last.
        * **Ephemeral dedup state** — a dedup table in memory is lost exactly when you need it (after a
          crash, §3). Dedup state must be durable.
        * **Resuming onto different data** — `Trainer.load_checkpoint` refuses a checkpoint whose
          `dataset_hash` differs from the current dataset.
        * **Speculative duplicates of non-idempotent work** — backup tasks are for computation only.
        * **Retry storms** — synchronized retries amplify an outage; use backoff with jitter and caps.

        ## Exercise

        1. Make `score_and_log` in §1 idempotent: write its row to `WORK/effects/<key>.txt` via a temp
           file + `os.replace`, skipping if the file exists. Show the side effect happens once despite
           the crash.
        2. Crash the `ExperimentSimulator` *between* the physical measurement and the journal append
           (e.g. subclass it). What is lost? How would you order the operations — or add a two-phase
           "requested → measured" record — so a real lab never repeats or loses a measurement?
        3. Using the Young/Daly formula, pick a checkpoint interval for a 2-hour DDP job on spot nodes
           with an MTBF of 3 hours, 90 s per epoch and 20 s per checkpoint.
