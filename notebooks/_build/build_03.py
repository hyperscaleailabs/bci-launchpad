    # 03 · Ray distributed execution

    **Goal.** Learn Ray's execution model — tasks, actors, ObjectRefs and the object store,
    scheduling on logical resources, serialization, backpressure, and failure handling —
    and see where each shows up in this platform. We implement the same workload
    (scoring a candidate pool with a trained surrogate) twice: once with **stateless
    tasks**, once with **stateful actors**, and compare with the repository's
    `inference.batch.predict_pool`.

    Division of labour in this platform: *Dagster* decides **when** and **what** runs
    (assets, lineage); *Ray* decides **where** computation runs and moves the data;
    *PyTorch* defines the model math.

    Resources are **logical**: `num_cpus=1` is a scheduling reservation, not a CPU

    `.remote()` returns **immediately** with an `ObjectRef`; the work runs asynchronously in
    a worker process. `ray.get` blocks for the value. Four 0.5-second tasks on 4 CPUs take
    ~0.5 s, not 2 s; eight take ~1 s (two waves — tasks are *queued*, never rejected).

    ## 3. The object store: `ray.put` once, pass references

    Arguments to `.remote()` are serialized into the object store. Passing a large array
    directly to $N$ tasks serializes it $N$ times; `ray.put` stores it **once** and every task
    receives the same ref. Ray resolves **top-level** ObjectRef arguments to values before
    the task runs — NumPy arrays come back as **zero-copy, read-only** views of shared
    memory on the same node. Refs nested inside a list/dict are *not* resolved.

    Note the timings: Ray is *slower* than the serial loop here. The whole job is ~40 ms of
    NumPy, while each task pays scheduling + serialization overhead (≈ 0.1–1 ms) and the
    first call pays for importing `bci_platform` in fresh worker processes. Distribute
    work only when per-task compute is much larger than that overhead: for an evaluation
    set this small the serial `evaluation.metrics.bootstrap_ci` is the better tool; the
    Ray version pays off for large evaluation sets and many resamples.

    ## 4. Scheduling and resources

    A task is scheduled only on a node with enough **free** logical resources for its
    request. Consequences:

    * `num_cpus=2` tasks on a 4-CPU node run at most 2 at a time;
    * a request that no node can *ever* satisfy is **infeasible** and stays pending forever
      (Ray logs a warning, it does not raise);
    * requests can be chosen at run time with `.options(...)`.

    **GPU caveat (Apple silicon).** Ray may advertise a `GPU` resource for an M-series
    Metal GPU, but PyTorch DDP/NCCL needs **CUDA**. The platform therefore never trusts
    Ray's raw GPU count: `ray_runtime.resources.cuda_gpu_count` returns 0 when the only
    accelerators are Apple (`accelerator_type:M…`), and `select_resources(cfg)` derives the
    request from what is actually usable.

    `select_resources` capped the 8 requested workers to the 4 CPUs of this Ray cluster and
    chose CPU execution; `run_accelerated_example` shows the pattern of a task that is
    *statically* annotated `num_gpus=1` (`gpu_matmul_benchmark`) being re-requested with
    `.options(num_gpus=0)` so it still runs on a CPU-only machine.

    ## 5. Serialization

    Ray serializes arguments, return values and the function/class itself with
    **cloudpickle** (plus zero-copy buffers for NumPy/Arrow). Anything captured by a
    closure is shipped too — a closure over a 1 GB array ships 1 GB with every function
    definition. Some objects cannot be serialized at all (locks, sockets, open files,
    CUDA contexts, DB connections): create them *inside* the task/actor instead.

    ## 6. Backpressure

    Because `.remote()` returns instantly, a loop over a million items submits a million
    tasks: their arguments and results pile up in driver memory and the object store.
    **Backpressure** bounds the number of in-flight tasks: submit up to $W$, then
    `ray.wait(..., num_returns=1)` for one to finish before submitting the next. Memory is
    $O(W)$ instead of $O(n)$, and throughput is unchanged as long as $W \ge$ the number of
    workers. The repo implements this as `ray_runtime.tasks.bounded_map`, and
    `inference.batch.predict_pool` uses the same window over actor calls.

    Window 2 halves throughput (only 2 of 4 CPUs busy); windows ≥ 4 match the unbounded run

    ## 7. Fault handling

    Two different kinds of failure:

    | Failure | Tasks | Actors |
    |---|---|---|
    | **system**: worker process dies (OOM-kill, segfault, node loss) | re-executed up to `max_retries` (default 3) | process restarted up to `max_restarts`; `__init__` runs again, **in-memory state is lost**; in-flight calls re-sent only if `max_task_retries > 0` |
    | **application**: the function raises | *not* retried unless `retry_exceptions=True` or a list of exception types | the exception is returned to the caller; the actor keeps running |

    Retrying is only safe for **idempotent** work. Recomputing a bootstrap resample is
    free and deterministic; re-running a *physical experiment* costs money and gives a
    different noisy answer. The repo encodes this difference explicitly.

    ## 8. One workload, two implementations: tasks vs actors

    Workload: score a 2 000-row candidate pool with MC dropout using a trained
    checkpoint. Loading the model is the expensive, *stateful* part.

    * **Task-based**: each shard task receives the checkpoint bytes (by ref) and the feature
      matrix (by ref), **loads the model**, scores its slice. Simple, stateless, trivially
      retryable — but pays model loading per shard.
    * **Actor-based**: $k$ actors load the model **once** in `__init__` and then score many
      shards. Amortizes loading; needs care on restart (state is rebuilt from the object store).

    Tasks paid the (simulated) load cost 8 times but ran 4-wide on warm workers; the 2
    actors paid it twice but also paid process start-up, and score only 2-wide. Which wins
    depends on *load cost × number of shards* versus *start-up + parallelism* — actors pay
    off for expensive, reusable state (large models, GPU contexts, DB connections) and
    long-lived services (Ray Serve, notebook 08).

    The `core_worker ... has constructor arguments in the object store and max_restarts > 0`
    line above is Ray warning about `ScoringActor.remote(ckpt_ref)`: on a restart Ray re-runs
    `__init__` with the *same* ObjectRef, but it does not pin constructor refs for that
    (ray-project/ray#53727). Here `ckpt_ref` stays alive in the notebook's globals, so a
    restart would still work. The repository's `PredictorActor` avoids the issue: its
    constructor takes only scalars and every `predict_shard` call carries `[ckpt_ref]` (a
    nested ref, not resolved per call); the actor loads the model once on first use, and a
    retried call brings the ref with it. `ExperimentSimulator` reads its candidate catalogue
    from a parquet path instead.

    Because MC-dropout seeds are attached to the **shard** (not to the worker), both
    implementations give identical numbers regardless of which process scored which shard
    — a requirement for retries to be safe. The repository's production version is
    `inference.batch.predict_pool` (actors + object store + `ray.wait` window), with the
    in-process reference `predict_pool_local` using the identical shard/seed schedule:

    ## 10. Failure modes

    * **Infeasible resource requests** (`num_gpus=1` on a CPU cluster, a custom resource no node has) pend forever — no error. Choose requests dynamically.
    * **Trusting Ray's GPU count on Apple silicon** — the Metal GPU is not CUDA; DDP/NCCL will fail.
    * **Unbounded submission** — driver/object-store memory blow-up, object spilling to disk; use a `ray.wait` window.
    * **Calling `ray.get` inside a loop right after each `.remote()`** — serializes the work (no parallelism).
    * **Passing large objects by value** to many tasks, or capturing them in closures — repeated serialization.
    * **Mutating zero-copy arrays** — they are read-only; copy first.
    * **Retrying non-idempotent work** (`retry_exceptions=True` on a task that writes or triggers an experiment) — duplicates side effects.
    * **Actor restarts lose in-memory state** — persist what matters (journal, object store, checkpoints).
    * **Oversubscription** — `num_cpus` is logical; a task that spawns 16 threads on a `num_cpus=1` slot fights its neighbours (set `torch.set_num_threads`).
    * **Named/detached actors outliving the job**, and leftover Ray processes if `ray.shutdown()` is skipped.

    ## 11. Exercise

    1. Rewrite `score_shard_task` so that shards are submitted through `bounded_map`; then vary `SHARD` (50, 250, 1000)
       and plot wall time for tasks vs actors. Where does model-loading overhead stop mattering?
    2. Make `ScoringActor.score` crash (`os._exit(1)`) on its 3rd call. With `max_restarts=1, max_task_retries=1`, do you
       still get all shards scored? Are the numbers identical? What changes with `max_task_retries=0`?
    3. Extend `ExperimentSimulator`-style idempotency to the task world: write a task that "runs an experiment"
       and records its result in a journal keyed by `(round_id, candidate_id)`, then make it safe to call with
       `max_retries=3`.
