    # 04 · Ray Train and resource management

    **Goal.** Connect notebook 02 (what happens *inside* DDP processes) with notebook 03
    (how Ray places work on resources). Ray Train is the layer that **creates the DDP
    process group on Ray-managed workers**: it reserves resources for all ranks at once,
    starts one worker process per rank, wires up `torch.distributed`, persists
    checkpoints, and restarts the group on failure.

    > *Ray determines where workers execute. PyTorch DDP determines how model replicas
    > synchronize gradients.* — `src/merge_platform/training/distributed.py`

    We (1) look at placement groups, (2) run a minimal `TorchTrainer` whose workers report
    what they observe (rank, world size, device, pid), (3) run the platform's
    `train_distributed` with 2 workers and inspect its distributed metadata, and (4) kill a
    worker mid-training and watch Ray Train recover from the last persisted checkpoint.

    ## 2. Placement groups — gang scheduling

    A DDP job with $N$ ranks is useless until *all* $N$ processes exist (the first
    collective blocks until everyone joins). Scheduling ranks one by one risks a deadlock:
    two jobs each grab half the GPUs and wait forever for the rest. A **placement group**
    reserves a set of resource *bundles* atomically; strategies control locality:
    `PACK` (as few nodes as possible — fast NCCL/shared memory; Ray Train's default),
    `SPREAD` (fault isolation), and the `STRICT_` variants that fail rather than compromise.

    ## 3. What a worker observes

    Inside `train_loop_per_worker`, `ray.train.get_context()` exposes the worker's place in
    the group; by the time the function runs, `torch.distributed` is already initialized.
    We collect what each worker sees (written to files in the run's storage, since
    `Result.metrics` only carries rank 0's report, and only when it has a checkpoint).

    ## 4. The platform's `train_distributed`

    `merge_platform.training.distributed.train_distributed(cfg, round_id=...)`:

    1. **Data movement** — reads the immutable round union from the `RoundStore` *once* on the
       driver, splits train/validation deterministically, and `ray.put`s both frames; every
       worker `ray.get`s the refs (zero-copy on the same node), so all ranks see byte-identical
       data with the same dataset hash.
    2. **Placement** — `select_resources` → `ScalingConfig`.
    3. **Workers** — `_train_loop_per_worker` runs the ordinary `Trainer` (DDP inside), and its
       `on_epoch_end` hook calls `ray.train.report` on every rank, attaching rank 0's
       checkpoint directory.
    4. **Summary** — at the end ranks `all_gather` their pid/host/parameter digest; the driver
       returns them in `TrainResult.device_info["distributed"]` (read with `distributed_info`).

    half of the training rows per epoch.

    ## 5. Failure and recovery

    `fail_at_epoch=2` makes the `Trainer` raise `SimulatedWorkerFailure` right after epoch
    2's checkpoint has been reported (and — via `ray.train.get_all_reported_checkpoints` —
    registered by the controller, so it is durable). With `max_failures=1` Ray Train:

    1. sees the worker error and tears down **the whole worker group** (a DDP group cannot
       continue with a missing rank);
    2. re-reserves resources and starts *new* worker processes;
    3. hands them the latest persisted checkpoint through `ray.train.get_checkpoint()`;
    4. `Trainer.load_checkpoint` restores model, optimizer, epoch, history and RNG state,
       and training continues at epoch 3.

    Recovery worked mechanically — new processes, resumed at epoch 3 from the persisted
    epoch-2 checkpoint, all 4 epochs in the history, replicas in sync — and epochs 1–2 are
    identical to the uninterrupted run. But in this run epochs 3–4 are **not bit-identical**,
    and the final predictions differ slightly. Why?

    The checkpoint is written by rank 0 and carries **rank 0's RNG state**. On resume,
    `Trainer.load_checkpoint` restores that state on rank 0, while ranks > 0 re-seed their
    dropout stream with `seed + 7919·(rank+1) + epoch` — a valid, deterministic stream, but
    not the one rank 1 would have continued with. Rank 1's dropout masks after the restart
    therefore differ, its gradients differ, and (through the all-reduce) so does the model.
    The single-process `Trainer` *does* resume bit-exactly, because there is only one RNG
    stream and it is in the checkpoint. Exact DDP resumption would require checkpointing
    **every rank's** RNG state (e.g. `all_gather` them into rank 0's payload); once the
    `Trainer` does that, the check above prints `True` for every epoch.

    Lesson: "deterministic" and "bit-reproducible after failure" are different claims;
    test the second one explicitly by comparing against an uninterrupted run, as done here.

    """),
    md(r"""
    ## 6. Retries, elasticity and their boundaries

    * **What is retried.** Ray Train restarts the *whole group* (DDP cannot lose a rank);
      `max_failures` counts group restarts (`-1` = forever). Work since the last persisted
      checkpoint is recomputed — checkpoint frequency trades I/O for lost work.
      Deterministic bugs fail again on every retry: retries fix *transient* failures only.
    * **Elasticity.** DDP's world size is fixed for the lifetime of a process group. Changing
      the number of workers means tearing the group down and re-forming it — i.e. a restart
      from a checkpoint. The Trainer resumes fine with a different world size, but the
      effective batch size changes (notebook 02), so the continued run is no longer
      bit-comparable. Growing/shrinking on the fly is possible (Ray Train supports a
      min/max worker range in newer APIs; torchrun has `--nnodes=min:max`), but always at a
      re-rendezvous boundary.
    * **Data movement.** Here the dataset is a few hundred rows, so `ray.put` once is the
      right choice. For data that does not fit in memory, `ray.data` streams shards to
      workers (`ray.train.get_dataset_shard`), overlapping I/O and training.
    * **Placement constraints.** A 4-GPU `PACK` job needs 4 free GPUs *at once*; on a busy
      cluster it waits (queueing) rather than starting partially.

    ## 8. Failure modes

    * **Requesting GPUs that are not CUDA** (Apple Metal) — schedules, then fails in NCCL/`cuda:` device calls.
    * **Infeasible `ScalingConfig`** (more workers × CPUs than the cluster has) — the job waits forever for its placement group.
    * **Only rank 0 calling `ray.train.report`** — the report is a collective; the other ranks hang.
    * **Worker-local checkpoint paths** — on a multi-node cluster `storage_path` must be shared storage (NFS/S3); a path on one node is invisible after the group moves.
    * **Failure injected before the checkpoint is durable** — recovery restarts from the *previous* epoch (why `_train_loop_per_worker` waits on `get_all_reported_checkpoints` before failing).
    * **Retrying deterministic bugs** — `max_failures` burns time and GPU hours; fail fast on non-transient errors.
    * **Every rank reading the dataset from disk / a database** — N× I/O and possibly N different snapshots; read once and broadcast via the object store, or use versioned data.
    * **Changing world size on resume** and expecting identical results.
    * **Too many kept checkpoints** filling the disk (`num_to_keep`).

    ## 9. Exercise

    1. Run `train_distributed(cfg, round_id=0, num_workers=1)` and compare `val_rmse` and `global_batch_size` with the
       2-worker baseline. Then set `training.batch_size` so the *effective* batch size matches and compare again.
    2. Call `train_distributed(..., fail_at_epoch=2, max_failures=0)`. What exception reaches the driver, and what is
       left in `ray_train_storage(cfg)`? Resume manually with `resume_from=` pointing at the persisted checkpoint.
    3. Request `num_workers=8` with `distributed.cpus_per_worker=1` on this 4-CPU Ray cluster. What does
       `select_resources` do? What would happen if you bypassed it and passed `ScalingConfig(num_workers=8)` directly?
