    # 00 · System map — how the platform fits together

    **Goal.** Before looking at any single framework, build a map of the *whole* model
    lifecycle and of which component owns which decision. Every later notebook zooms into

    really are separate.

    ## 1. The lifecycle

    The platform exists to run an *iterative scientific campaign*: experiments are expensive,
    so a surrogate model decides which experiments to run next, and every new round of
    measurements retrains the model.

    The loop closes *through data*: the output of round $r$ is not a model, it is a new
    immutable dataset `round_{r+1}`. That single design choice drives most of the
    architecture — datasets need identity, lineage and write-once semantics, and the
    orchestrator must treat them as first-class objects (assets), not as intermediate
    values of a script.

    ## 2. Five planes

    | Plane | Question it answers | Durable state | Implemented by |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | **Data plane** | *What* was measured, and what is it called? | `data/candidate_pool/`, `data/rounds/round_XXX/{observations.parquet, manifest.json}`, selections, lab journal | `bci_platform.data.RoundStore` (write-once, hash-chained) |
    | **Compute plane** | *Where* and on *how many* workers does work run? | none (ephemeral workers, object store) | Ray: Ray Train (DDP), Ray tasks, Ray actors |
    | **Workflow control plane** | *What* runs *when*, in which order, for which round, and what did it produce? | Dagster run/event storage (`$DAGSTER_HOME`) | Dagster assets, jobs, partitions, sensors, schedules |
    | **Metadata plane** | *Which* run produced which model with which params/metrics/artifacts, and which model is trusted? | MLflow tracking DB + artifact store, model registry | `bci_platform.tracking` (the only MLflow importer) |
    | **Serving plane** | *How* are predictions delivered at low latency to callers? | none (replicas reload from registry) | Ray Serve deployment `SurrogateModelDeployment` |

    The scientific code (`data`, `models`, `training/trainer.py`, `evaluation`,
    `active_learning`) sits *underneath* all five planes: it is plain Python/PyTorch and can
    be called from a unit test, a notebook, a Ray worker or a Dagster asset identically.
    """),
    md(r"""
    ## 3. Who owns what

    | Component | Owns | Explicitly does **not** own |
    |---|---|---|
    | **PyTorch** | model definition (`ResidualMLP`), loss, autograd, optimizer step, DDP gradient all-reduce, checkpoint *contents* | how many workers exist or where they run; which dataset version is trained on; whether the model is good enough |
    | **Ray** (core + Train) | processes/actors, placement of work on CPUs/GPUs, object store, worker failure detection, DDP process-group setup via `TorchTrainer` | *when* a pipeline step runs, dataset identity, lineage, promotion decisions, durable history (a Ray cluster is ephemeral) |
    | **Dagster** | the asset graph, *when* each asset is (re)materialized, partitions (= rounds), retries of whole steps, sensors/schedules, materialization metadata, lineage across runs | per-worker scheduling, GPU assignment, model semantics, the metrics' meaning; it never holds the data itself (asset values here are small path/hash records) |
    | **MLflow** | run identity, params/metrics/tags, artifacts (checkpoint, evaluation report), registered model versions + lifecycle aliases | deciding promotion (the evaluation gate decides, MLflow records it), running anything, dataset storage |
    | **Kubernetes** (KubeRay, `infra/k8s/`) | nodes, pods, resource requests/limits, GPU device plugins, node pools, restarts of *pods*, persistent volumes | Python-level scheduling of tasks inside the Ray cluster, experiment lineage, training logic |
    | **Ray Serve** | online inference: replicas, request routing, dynamic batching (`@serve.batch`), autoscaling of replicas | which model is production (it *reads* the registry's `production` alias), training, offline pool scoring (Ray actors do that) |

    A useful test for every new piece of code: *which row of this table is it answering?*
    If the answer is "two rows", the code is in the wrong place.

    ## 5. Derivation: the identity of a training dataset

    A model is only reproducible if the dataset it was trained on has a stable name. Rounds
    are appended, never edited, so the training set of round $r$ is
    $D_r = \bigcup_{i \le r} \text{round}_i$. The `RoundStore` names it with a hash chain:

    $$
    c_i = H(\text{content of round}_i), \qquad
    m_i = H\big(i,\; n_i,\; c_i,\; [\,m_{i-1}\,]\big), \qquad
    \text{dataset\_hash}(D_r) = m_r .
    $$

    Because $m_r$ contains $m_{r-1}$, which contains $m_{r-2}$, …, changing a single value in
    any earlier round changes $m_r$ (up to hash collisions). So the one string
    `dataset_hash` recorded on an MLflow run and on a Dagster materialization commits to
    *every* observation the model saw. Provenance (`created_at`, who ran it) is deliberately
    **not** hashed, so a retried materialization of the same measurements has the same
    identity. We verify both claims on real data in §9.

    ## 6. Import boundaries, proven

    The separation in §3 is only real if the source code respects it. Scan every module in
    `src/bci_platform` with `ast` (this catches imports nested inside functions too, e.g.
    the lazy Ray imports in `orchestration/pipeline.py`) and record which frameworks each

    | Concept on the map | Where it lives |
    |---|---|
    | data plane, write-once rounds, hash chain | `src/bci_platform/data/datasets.py` → `RoundStore.write_round`, `dataset_hash`, `verify_chain`; `data/schema.py` → `RoundManifest.manifest_hash` |
    | synthetic lab / oracle | `data/synthetic_oracle.py` → `SyntheticOracle`; `ray_runtime/tasks.py` → `ExperimentSimulator` actor |
    | pure training loop | `training/trainer.py` → `Trainer.train` (single-process and DDP-aware) |
    | compute plane: distributed training | `training/distributed.py` → `train_distributed` (Ray Train `TorchTrainer`) |
    | evaluation + gates | `evaluation/evaluator.py` → `evaluate`, `check_gates` |
    | decision | `active_learning/loop.py` → `select_batch`, `write_selection` |
    | the step functions (no Dagster import) | `orchestration/pipeline.py` → `ensure_candidate_pool`, `observe_round`, `build_training_dataset`, `train_model`, `evaluate_model`, `register_model`, `score_candidates`, `select_experiments`, `run_experiments`; `RayCompute` |
    | workflow control plane | `orchestration/assets.py`, `jobs.py` (`run_bootstrap`, `run_round`), `partitions.py`, `sensors.py`, `resources.py`, `definitions.py` (`build_definitions`, `defs`) |
    | metadata plane | `tracking/mlflow_client.py` → `Tracker`; `tracking/registry.py` → `ModelRegistry.promote_if_passed` |

    ## 11. Failure modes (architectural)

    * **Science inside Dagster assets.** If the acquisition function or the loss is written
      in an `@asset` body it cannot be unit-tested, reused from a notebook or run on a Ray
      worker, and every change to the science changes the orchestration code. Here assets are
      ~20 lines of glue each; the science is importable without Dagster (§6, §9).
    * **Cluster logic in model code.** `ray.get`, `num_gpus=` or `if rank == 0: mlflow.log…`
      inside the model/trainer couples the model to one runtime. The `Trainer` only knows
      `torch.distributed`; Ray Train sets up the process group from outside.
    * **Orchestrator as data store.** Passing DataFrames between assets through the IO
      manager duplicates data into `$DAGSTER_HOME` without identity. Asset values here are
      path/hash records; data lives in the RoundStore/MLflow.
    * **Mutable datasets.** Overwriting `round_003` in place silently invalidates every model
      and report that references it. The store refuses (§9); corrections are new rounds.
    * **Training finished ⇒ promoted.** A model that ran without error is not a better model.
      Promotion goes through evaluation gates; the registry records the decision.
    * **Ray as a scheduler of record.** A Ray cluster is ephemeral: its task history vanishes
      on restart. "What ran when, on which data" must live in Dagster + MLflow.
    * **Serving reads a file path.** Serving a checkpoint path instead of the registry's
      `production` alias bypasses the gate and breaks rollback.

    ## 12. Exercise

    1. Add a fake violation: in a scratch copy of the source list, pretend
       `active_learning/acquisition.py` imports `mlflow` (edit the `imports` DataFrame) and
       confirm the rule check in §6 fails. Then write the same rule as a pytest.
    2. Extend §7 to print, for each job, which assets it selects **and** which it does not
       (hint: `defs.resolve_job_def("retrain_job")`). Why does `retrain_job` stop at
       `registered_model`?
    3. Using §9, write `round_002` by hand with a *different* selection for round 1, and
       predict what `P.run_experiments` would do if a Dagster run later tried to materialize
       `new_experimental_results[round_000]` with the original selection.
    4. Place a hypothetical new component — a feature store for molecular descriptors — on the
       five-plane map. Which component should own its versioning, and which must not?
