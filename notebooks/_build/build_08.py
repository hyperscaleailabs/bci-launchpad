        # 08 · Distributed inference: batch scoring and online serving

        After a model passes its evaluation gate it is used in two very different ways:

        | | **Batch (offline) inference** | **Online inference** |
        |---|---|---|
        | example in this platform | score the whole candidate pool for active learning | a scientist / service asks "what would this design measure?" |
        | unit of work | a shard of 10⁴–10⁶ rows | one request (1 row or a small list) |
        | objective | **throughput** (rows/s), cost | **latency** (P50/P95/P99) at a given load |
        | failure handling | retry the shard (pure function) | retry the request, shed load (HTTP 503) |
        | repository | `inference/batch.py` → `predict_pool` (Ray actors) | `inference/serve.py` → `build_app` / `run` (Ray Serve) |

        This notebook trains a small checkpoint, runs both paths, and measures the latency/throughput
        trade-off of **dynamic batching**, **concurrency** and **replicas**.

                                           one forward pass over B rows ──► B responses
        ```

        **Cost model of a forward pass.** For a small MLP on CPU, the time to process a batch of $B$
        rows is roughly affine, $T(B) = a + bB$, where $a$ (Python/dispatch/kernel-launch overhead) is
        large relative to the per-row cost $b$. Throughput of a replica that always runs full batches:

        $$X(B) = \frac{B}{a + bB} \;\xrightarrow{B\to\infty}\; \frac1b, \qquad X(1) = \frac{1}{a+b}.$$

        Batching buys up to a factor $(a+b)/b$ in throughput, paid for with waiting time (up to
        `batch_wait_timeout_s`) plus the longer forward pass.

        **Little's law.** In any stable queueing system, the average number of requests in the system
        $L$, the arrival (= completion) rate $\lambda$ and the mean time in system $W$ satisfy

        $$L = \lambda W.$$

        *Derivation sketch:* over a long window $[0,\tau]$, let $A(\tau)$ requests arrive and let
        $\int_0^\tau N(t)\,dt$ be the area under the "requests in system" curve. Each request contributes
        its sojourn time to the area, so area $\approx \sum_i W_i = A(\tau)\,\bar W$. Dividing by $\tau$:
        $\bar N = (A(\tau)/\tau)\,\bar W = \lambda \bar W$. ∎

        A closed-loop load generator with $c$ concurrent clients keeps $L=c$, so
        $W = c/\lambda$: once the server saturates ($\lambda$ stops growing), **every extra concurrent
        client adds latency and no throughput**. That is the regime where backpressure (queue caps,
        HTTP 503) and autoscaling matter.

        On a laptop-sized pool the actor start-up (a new process, `import torch`, loading the model)
        is comparable to the scoring itself; the design pays off when the pool is large, when a

        * With `max_batch_size=1`, every request is its own forward pass. Throughput saturates at about
          $1/T(1)$ plus HTTP overhead, and beyond that latency grows linearly with concurrency — exactly
          $W = c/\lambda$.
        * With `max_batch_size=32`, concurrent requests are coalesced (see `mean_batch`, measured from the
          replica's own counters on `/model-info`). Throughput is roughly 2x higher at moderate
          concurrency and latency at high load is far lower. At concurrency 1 there is nothing to
          batch; a request may even wait up to `batch_wait_timeout_s` for company, so P50 *rises*.
        * On one laptop the load generator (Python threads), the HTTP proxy and the replica share the
          same cores. At the highest concurrency the client and proxy — not the model — become the

        ## 4 · Backpressure, model loading, accelerator memory, autoscaling

        **Backpressure** (in `build_app`): `max_ongoing_requests = max(2·max_batch_size, 32)` per
        replica — a full batch can form, but no replica accepts unbounded work; excess requests wait in
        the proxy/handle queue, and beyond `max_queued_requests = 4096` Serve answers **HTTP 503**
        instead of letting latency grow without bound (the Little's-law regime above). Clients should
        treat 503 as "retry later with jitter". Batch inference applies the same idea on the driver:
        `predict_pool(max_in_flight=...)` keeps at most that many shard calls outstanding.

        **Model loading.** Each replica loads the checkpoint in `__init__`
        (`Predictor.from_checkpoint`); `/model-info` reports `load_s`. Scale-up latency = pod/actor start +
        image/env + model load; for large models this dominates and is the reason to keep a warm minimum
        of replicas. On a multi-node cluster the checkpoint path must be on shared storage (or the
        checkpoint baked into the image) — the batch path avoids that by shipping checkpoint bytes via
        the object store.

        inference uses bounded shards — a single huge request must not OOM a GPU replica that other
        requests share. For multi-GB models the balance flips: weights dominate, one replica per GPU,
        and fractional `num_gpus` packing is only possible when several models fit together.

        **Autoscaling.** `build_app(..., autoscaling=True)` replaces `num_replicas` by

        ```python
        {"min_replicas": 1, "initial_replicas": n_rep, "max_replicas": max(n_rep, max_replicas),
         "target_ongoing_requests": max(1, max_batch_size // 2),
         "upscale_delay_s": 5, "downscale_delay_s": 30}
        ```

        Serve adds replicas when the average number of ongoing requests per replica exceeds the target
        (i.e. it controls $L$ per replica, hence latency via Little's law). On Kubernetes, new replicas
        that do not fit become pending Ray resource demand → the KubeRay autoscaler adds worker pods →
        the node autoscaler adds nodes (notebook 12). Each layer adds start-up latency; scale-down is
        delayed longer than scale-up to avoid flapping.

        ## Failure modes

        * **Unbounded queues** — without a queue cap, overload shows up as ever-growing latency and
          eventually OOM rather than a clean 503.
        * **Tail latency from batching** — a lone request can wait `batch_wait_timeout_s`; set it well
          below the latency SLO. Very large `max_batch_size` raises P99 under bursty load.
        * **Oversubscription** — replicas × torch threads > cores gives worse throughput than fewer
          replicas (threads fight for cores). `replica_resources` clamps threads per replica.
        * **Model load storms** — scaling from 0 → N replicas simultaneously reads the checkpoint N times;
          cold starts violate SLOs. Keep `min_replicas ≥ 1` for online paths.
        * **Non-reproducible responses** — MC-dropout masks span the batch, so a row's `std` can vary
          slightly with batch composition (documented in `SurrogateModelDeployment._infer`). Batch
          inference seeds per shard to stay deterministic.
        * **Version skew** — during a rolling update, two model versions answer concurrently; every
          response carries `model_version` so downstream consumers can tell.

        ## Exercise

        1. Re-run the sweep with `batch_wait_timeout_s=0.05`. What happens to P50 at concurrency 1 and
           to throughput at concurrency 48? Explain with the cost model $T(B)=a+bB$.
        2. Using the fitted $a, b$ from §1, predict the saturation throughput for `max_batch_size=32`
           and compare with the measurement. Where does the remaining gap come from?
        3. Write a small open-loop load generator (fixed arrival rate $\lambda$, Poisson inter-arrivals)
           and find the $\lambda$ at which P99 exceeds 100 ms for each configuration.
