The single place that decides *which* Ray cluster the platform talks to.

local in-process cluster (laptop), a Docker Compose head node, or KubeRay.

Resolution order: explicit ``address`` argument, then ``RAY_ADDRESS`` env var,
otherwise start a local cluster.

    Ray Train's ``PlacementGroupCleaner`` actor polls the State API with no

    one local Ray instance running (parallel notebooks / test sessions /
    `make` targets) discovery raises ``ConnectionError: Found multiple active
    Ray instances`` inside the cleaner's monitor thread, which then dies with
    a traceback forwarded to the driver after *every* Ray Train run (and
    stops guarding the placement group). Exporting the worker's own GCS
    address makes discovery unambiguous. Runs in every worker process of the
    job (runtime envs are inherited by child tasks/actors, including Ray
    Train's controller and its detached cleaner).

    (Separately, with ``include_dashboard=False`` — as in the tests — the State
    API itself is absent, so the cleaner logs "Failed to query Ray Train
    Controller actor state ... Continuing to monitor" a few times per run.
    That is harmless: on a normal exit the controller removes its placement
    group itself; the cleaner only matters if the controller is killed.)
