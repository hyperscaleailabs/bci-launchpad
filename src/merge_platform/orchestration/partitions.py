"""Experimental rounds as Dagster dynamic partitions (``round_000``, ``round_001``, ...).

Rounds are *dynamic*: nobody knows in advance how many experimental rounds a
campaign will run, and a new round comes into existence only when the lab
(``new_experimental_results``) or an external process writes it to the
RoundStore. Partition keys are identical to RoundStore directory names, so a
Dagster partition and ``data/rounds/<key>/`` always refer to the same
immutable dataset.
