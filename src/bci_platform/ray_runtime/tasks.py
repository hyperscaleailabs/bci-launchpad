"""Generic Ray workloads: stateless tasks, a stateful actor, object refs, backpressure.

Ray concepts demonstrated here (see also notebook 03):

**Tasks** (``@ray.remote`` functions) are stateless units of work. Ray's
scheduler places each task on a node with enough free *logical* resources
(``num_cpus``/``num_gpus``); tasks are queued, not rejected, when the cluster
is busy. Tasks are the right tool for embarrassingly parallel computation
such as bootstrap resampling or scoring shards of a candidate pool.

**Object store / ObjectRefs.** ``ray.put(x)`` stores ``x`` once in the
node-local shared-memory object store and returns an ``ObjectRef``. Passing
the ref (not the array) to N tasks means the array is serialized once, and
numpy arrays are read *zero-copy* by workers on the same node. Passing the
raw array to each ``.remote()`` call would serialize it N times. Top-level
ObjectRef arguments are resolved to values before the task runs; refs nested
inside containers stay refs (the task must ``ray.get`` them).

**Backpressure.** ``.remote()`` returns immediately, so a naive loop can
submit millions of tasks and exhaust driver/object-store memory. :func:`bounded_map`
keeps at most ``max_in_flight`` tasks outstanding and uses ``ray.wait`` to
admit a new task only when one finishes.

**Failure / retry semantics.**

* Tasks: ``max_retries`` re-executes a task whose *worker process died*
  (system failure). Application exceptions are retried only if
  ``retry_exceptions`` is ``True`` or lists the exception types. This is safe
  only for **idempotent, side-effect-free** computation — bootstrap
  resampling with a fixed seed returns the same answer on every attempt.
* Actors: ``max_restarts`` restarts a dead actor process (its ``__init__``
  runs again, in-memory state is lost); ``max_task_retries`` controls whether
  in-flight method calls are re-sent to the restarted actor.

**Retrying computation vs re-running an experiment.** :class:`ExperimentSimulator`
stands in for a *physical* experiment (the synthetic oracle). A lab
measurement costs money and time and its outcome is not reproducible, so it
must never be blindly retried. The actor therefore (a) uses
``max_task_retries=0`` (at-most-once method execution after a crash), and
(b) makes ``measure`` idempotent: results are recorded per
``(round_id, candidate_id)`` in a measurement log (optionally journaled to
disk so it survives an actor restart), and a retried request returns the
recorded measurement instead of measuring again. Durable versioning happens
downstream in the write-once ``RoundStore``.

**Placement.** Tasks/actors are placed by resource availability (and
optionally ``scheduling_strategy="SPREAD"`` or placement groups, which Ray
Train uses to gang-schedule all DDP workers at once, ``PACK`` by default).

    State: the oracle, the candidate pool, and a measurement log keyed by

    again for a measurement that was already performed returns the recorded
    value (``n_physical_measurements`` does not increase). This is the
    difference between retrying *computation* (cheap, deterministic, safe to
    repeat) and re-running a *scientific experiment* (expensive, noisy,
    irreversible — must be recorded once and re-used).

    ``max_restarts=1`` restarts a crashed actor, but ``max_task_retries=0``
    means Ray will *not* automatically re-send an in-flight ``measure`` call
    to the restarted actor; the caller must decide (the first call after a
    crash raises ``ActorUnavailableError``/``ActorDiedError``). With
    ``journal_path`` the log is appended to a JSONL file and reloaded in
    ``__init__`` so a restart does not forget which experiments were already run.

    Restart-safe construction: ``__init__`` runs again on every restart with
    the *same* arguments, so they must still be valid then. The candidate
    catalogue is therefore passed as a **parquet path** on durable storage
    (the RoundStore's ``candidate_pool/pool.parquet`` in the closed loop), not
    as an ObjectRef — Ray does not pin constructor ObjectRefs for restarts
    (ray-project/ray#53727), and the lab reads its catalogue from the same
    storage it journals to. A DataFrame is accepted for direct, in-process use.
